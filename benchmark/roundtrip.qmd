title: Testing the speed of nycflights roundtrip
format: gfm

nycflights round trip is an example in the `writexl` documentation. The original code looks like so:

```r
library(nycflights13)
out <- readxl::read_xlsx(writexl::write_xlsx(flights))
all.equal(out, flights)
```

Let's break it down

```{r}
#| label: writexl
date()
library(nycflights13)
system.time(path <- writexl::write_xlsx(flights))
system.time(out <- readxl::read_xlsx(path))
all.equal(out, flights)
```

The ODS version

```{r}
#| label: readODS
devtools::load_all()
system.time(path <- readODS::write_ods(flights))
system.time(out <- readODS::read_ods(path))
all.equal(out, flights)
```


```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
